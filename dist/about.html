          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            I lived my childhood in a small and quite city. Next important
            moment was moving and living in United States for a period of 10
            months where I experienced the touch of a new culture. For the past
            2 years I lived in London a very divers city and I swtiched my
            attention into the tech field.

          <h3>Academic status</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently in my second year undergoing a Bsc Human Nutrition
            course. I am doing this for personal interest as nutrition is an
            important aspect in my life. During this course I gained many
            academic skills but most importantly I improved my time-management.
            Working full time and studying in the same time was a bit of a
            challenge.

          <h3>Perspective</h3>
          <p>
            If you read all the way up to this you may wonder why am I applying
            for this position. The reason is that I am so excited that I am very
            excited that I found a field that is so mentally stimulating and in
            continuous development. I love learning new things. I know that I
            have one thing that can be very useful for a company. I want to
            master my profession and I would spend most of my money and time in
            shaping my education.
