          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            I lived in a small and quite city before I left my country and moved
            in USA for about 10 months where I experienced the touch of a new
            culture. For the past 2 years I lived in London a very diverse city
            and I swtiched my attention into the tech field.

          <h3>Academic status</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently in my second year undergoing Human Nutrition course.
            As nutrition is an important aspect in my life I thought I should
            give it a go. During this course I gained useful skills amongst
            which the most important was to improve my time-management. Working
            and studying full time simultaneously is and was a positive and
            helpful experience.

          <h3>Perspective</h3>
          <p>
            If you read all the way down to here you may wonder why am I
            applying for this position. The reason is that I am so excited and
            happy that I found a field that is so mentally stimulating and in
            continuous development. I like learning new thing and I know that I
            have at least one thing that can be very useful for every company. I
            want to master my profession and I would spend most of my money and
            time in shaping my education.
